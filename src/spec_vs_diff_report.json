  "summary": "The diff primarily updates documentation/state files (DEPLOYMENT.md, LIVE_URL.md, project_state.json) and a frontend file summary. It does not provide evidence of an actual successful Internet Computer deployment, nor of updating the backend live-URL reference. It also introduces substantial new/changed frontend feature descriptions (games/UI) in the summaries, which conflicts with the “deployment-only, no feature changes” constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish the current Valentine’s wish/Valentine’s Surprise project as a permanent (non-expiring) live site on the Internet Computer using the platform-provided default domain (no custom domain configuration).",
      "reason": "The diff contains documentation asserting a live URL, but no evidence of actual deployment configuration/output or code changes that would accomplish a successful IC deployment; also no evidence of updating the backend live-URL comment mentioned in the BuildRequest constraint.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If the deployment workflow requires specifying a domain/slug, generate and use a random valid slug that is 5–50 characters and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.",
      "reason": "A slug is documented, but the diff provides no evidence it was generated randomly or actually used in an automated/successful deployment workflow (no deployment scripts/config changes or deployment logs shown).",

      "description": "Introduced/changed multiple frontend features and UI elements (jigsaw puzzle CTA/reveal flow, snowflake catching mini-game, floating hearts, sparkles/confetti, new styling/theme changes) despite the request being deployment-only with no feature changes.",

    {
      "description": "Added a comprehensive deployment runbook (DEPLOYMENT.md) with extensive instructions/troubleshooting beyond the requested scope of deploying the existing project and keeping URL references consistent.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not ask for new documentation/runbooks; it only required deployment and updating existing in-repo URL references via the existing feature mechanism.",

        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated project tracking/state to include new 'AR-*' items and to describe deployment as failing due to invalid domain format.",
