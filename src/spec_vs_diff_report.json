REQ-19 and REQ-20 cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff, though the file summary claims pointer-event based drag support, snapping, and unchanged reveal behavior.",

      "requirement": "Fix the jigsaw puzzle interaction so it is playable (pieces can be picked up, dragged, and dropped reliably) on both desktop and touch devices, including preventing page scroll during drag and keeping snap-to-slot behavior.",
      "reason": "The core interaction logic (pointer/touch handlers, preventDefault to stop scrolling, snap-to-grid, and drop/end-drag behavior) is not visible in the provided truncated diff for the jigsaw component, so implementation cannot be confirmed from diff evidence alone.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the post-puzzle experience remains unchanged: completing the puzzle triggers the existing completion behavior and reveals the existing Valentine message after completion (no copy changes to the revealed message).",
      "reason": "While PuzzleRevealSection still renders ValentineMessageReveal when isCompleted is true, the diff does not show the surrounding App-level completion wiring or confirm the revealed message copy was not modified (ValentineMessageReveal is not part of this diff). Therefore the full end-to-end completion/reveal behavior and unchanged message text cannot be conclusively verified from the diff summary alone.",
